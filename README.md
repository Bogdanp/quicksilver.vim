# Installation

Use [pathogen][1] and clone this repo into your ~/.vim/bundle directory.

# Usage

By default, `\q` will activate the Quicksilver buffer and switch to
insert mode. Typing any key will update the list of suggestions and
pressing `CR` will open the first item in the suggestion list. Use `C-c`
to quickly close the buffer.

Pressing `Tab` or `CR` when there's no pattern will go up a directory.

`C-w` clears the entire pattern. If there is no pattern, it will go up a
directory.

If a file with the given pattern does not exist then it will be created
and opened for editing, patterns ending in `/` create new folders
instead.

Patterns that start or end in a wildcard (`*`) are treated as glob
patterns. For example, the pattern `*.md` will open all the files that
have the extension `.md` in the CWD.

# Requirements

* VIM 7.0+ compiled with +python
* Python 2.6+
